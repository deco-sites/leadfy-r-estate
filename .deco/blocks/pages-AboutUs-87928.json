      "storyContent": "<p>The world didn’t need another real estate brokerage. It needed something different. Something more. It needed something with the imagination and insight to upend a broken model. A structure that empowers instead of extinguishes the unique potential in each of us. A collection of like minds that understand the potential of technology and building lasting connections. A Brokerage 3.0 that makes no apologies for making the old guard uncomfortable.<br><br><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW114139476 BCX0\">As a company born in the chaos of a global&nbsp;</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW114139476 BCX0\">pandemic, where others saw stumbling blocks, we saw&nbsp;</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW114139476 BCX0\">stepping stones</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW114139476 BCX0\">.

But to spot what’s hidden in plain sight, latent, or undiscovered—in a person, property, or even an entire industry—we need to look at the world differently. And seizing that potential takes something more. At SERHANT., we rely on creativity, camaraderie, grit, and optimism. We have a healthy disregard for the status quo, and, above all, we are relentless in the pursuit of what’s possible.<br></p>",
